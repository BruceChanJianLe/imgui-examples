Thanks to `Jefferson Amstutz` [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIGHalVqSBE&ab_channel=JeffersonAmstutz) on FetchContent and his [project](https://github.com/jeffamstutz/ANARI-SDK) tag v0.1.0, we are able to get imgui library to link to this project!


There is also an interactive website to quickly find reference to the imgui section that you need [https://pthom.github.io/imgui_manual_online/manual/imgui_manual.html].
